            Every year Australia experiences a large amount of Bushfires with varying 
            intensity, being known as a dry and arid land these can have devastating effects.
            This visualisation will explore how through recent years the frequency,

                location and 
            temperature of these bush fires have evolved, it will also explore potential explanatory
            conditions that may influence these bushfires such as the changing temperature, 
            possible due to climate change.

            <h3 id="title">Spread of Fire</h3>
            <p id="text">
                From the map, it can be observed that majority of the fires occur 
                within a few hundred kilometres of the coast, this is expected as this is 
                where majority of the flora is located, being susceptible to the harsh
                environmental conditions. Looking closer, a large majority of the data points
                lie along the top of the country potentially due to the hotter
                conditions being located to the equator. It is worth noting that the middle
                portion of Australia is mostly desert conditions, so despite the 
                warmer conditions is unable to sustain bushfires, thus the lack in the middle of the country.

            <h3 id="title">Annual Temperature Evolution</h3>
            <p id="text">
                Inspecting the map it reveals that along the south-east and southern borders
                the average maximum temperature is significantly lower than at points closer 
                to the equator. This information supports the bushfire distribution map where 
                a larger frequency is recorded along the top of Australia. Moving through time
                on this map, the weather stations record an increase in the average annual temperature
                suggesting a nation wide increase, which may be a cause in an increase of bushfires.

                <h3 id="title">Increase in Fires</h3>
                <p id="text">
                    From the graph it suggests that there is a trend of increasing
                    bushfires in Australia on a yearly basis, this could be due to 
                    warmer conditions, drier conditions or more people setting fires. An
                    important consideration to be made is that recording mechanisms may have 
                    improved over time leading to more results being captured than have been
                    in the past.

                <h3 id="title">Distribution by State</h3>
                <p id="text">
                    As expected more northern states such as NSW and WA recorded the highest
                    amount of bushfires in the whole time period, with southern states as TAS and SA 
                    demonstrating a low count. Interestingly VIC had the third highest recorded count of 
                    fires over the whole period.

            <h3 id="title">Change in Ingnition Cause</h3>
            <p id="text">
                Comparing the two charts, there has been a noticeable increase in 
                the amount of fires that have been caused by accidental or incendiary means,
                with a slight uptick in those generated by natural means. This suggests that 
                the cause for this increase of bushfires demonstrated by the line chart may not 
                be all environmentally sourced but due to nefarious or neglectful acts.
